# üõ†Ô∏è SQL to PostgreSQL Database Migration - Employee Table

## üìã Project Description

This repository documents the process of migrating a database table from **MySQL (SQL Workbench)** to **PostgreSQL**. The migration centers around an `Employee` table initially created and structured in MySQL, and then successfully moved to a PostgreSQL environment.

## üéØ Objectives

- Create a well-defined `Employee` table schema in **MySQL Workbench**
- Populate the table with sample employee data
- Export the data and schema
- Import the schema and data into **PostgreSQL**
- Verify the successful migration with queries and data integrity checks

## üß± Tech Stack

- **MySQL Workbench** for initial table design and data entry
- **PostgreSQL** as the target database
- SQL for DDL and DML operations
- pgAdmin / psql CLI for PostgreSQL interaction
- Optional tools: DBeaver / DataGrip for multi-database management

## üß∞ Tools Used

- **MySQL Workbench** ‚Äì for initial table creation and data management
- **PostgreSQL (v17)** ‚Äì as the target database for migration
- **pgAdmin / psql CLI** ‚Äì for PostgreSQL schema and data import
- **CSV format** ‚Äì used as intermediate data format for easy transfer
- **Notepad++ / VSCode** ‚Äì for editing and validating SQL/CSV files

‚úÖ Conclusion
The migration of the employees table from MySQL to PostgreSQL was completed successfully using standard tools and formats. The process included:

Designing compatible schemas

Exporting and transforming data as CSV

Using PostgreSQL's COPY command for efficient data import

This method ensures a clean, consistent, and fast transfer of structured data between SQL database platforms.
